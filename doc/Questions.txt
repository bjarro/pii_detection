Whitespace in a document
 - Is formatting preserved?
   - Do consecutive whitespaces correlate with the existence of a PII nearby
 - Can presence/absence of trailing whitespace predict if the next value is PII or not


Problem
 - What is the main problem we are trying to solve
   - Is it that NER models dont predict the PII we are trying to identify
   - Or is that we dont know if the output of the NER model is PII or not?
