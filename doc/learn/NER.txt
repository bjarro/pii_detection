--- Data Preparation and Annotation

Learn about Named Entity Recognition (NER). Understand what entities are and why NER is crucial for various NLP applications.

Advantages and disadvantages of different annotation schemes like BIO (Begin, Inside, Outside).

Usual process of manually annotating data for NER tasks

--- Feature Engineering and Representation
Explore various features used in NER, including word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), character embeddings, and context window features.

Understand the importance of feature engineering in training NER models. Learn about feature representation techniques, such as TF-IDF.

--- NER Algorithms and Models

Study popular NER algorithms and models, such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and deep learning-based models like Bidirectional LSTMs or Transformers
.
Days 37-40: Experiment with pre-trained NER models provided by libraries like spaCy or transformers (Hugging Face).
