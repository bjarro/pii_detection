Question:

In Tokenize Function:

1. Convert label to model id
  - Must be converted back to dataset id before computing metrics
  - Training:
    - Can continue training using original head
  
  
2. Dont do conversion
  - (Uniform) - Can be directly used with compute_metrics
  - Training:
     - Can't continue training using original head
     - will try to learn new dataset labels inefficiently (possible different alignment and # of labels)
