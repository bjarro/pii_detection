When to convert to BIO


Tokens
A - from Model id (actual prediction): No - No BIO version
 A.A  - YES - convert first to dataset entities
 A.B  - YES - create BIO mappings of model labels (unnecessary)
B - from dataset id (actual prediction): Depends on label alignment from words 
 B.A - NO - Approach 1 already in same BIO 
 B.B - YES - Just to see possible token-level performance (unnecessary)
        - 'B-'labels will be likely converted to 'I-' during majority voting (conversion to words)
 B.C  - Yes - Approach 2 - Unhandled
      - 


Word
1 - from dataset token (actual prediction / aligned prediction): Depends on result
   1.1 - NO - See actual result of fine-tune model
   1.2 - YES - If better performance

2 - from dataset token (converted from to_bio_vect): 
  - YES - need to run again because previous to_bio_vect results is aligned based on subwords
  
3 - from model tokens (non-bio, actual prediction): YES
  3.1- Yes - convert to dataset entities - run BIO




Label alignment

Approach 1:
 - first subword of entity is B-
 - equivalent to first subword of 'B-' word is 'B-', everything else is 'I-'

Approach 2:
 - Distribute word labels to words



Yanis adapted
 - A.A - conv to dataset_id -> BIO
 - 2 - rerun BIO


Yanis fine-tuned
 - B.A - Do nothing
 - 1.1 - Do nothing or 1.2 (currently 1.2) - BIO


Possible Cases:

Token
 - to dataset entities -> to Bio 
 - Do nothing

Word
 - Convert to dataset entities -> To BIO
 - Do Nothing


Implementation:

booleans:

will_bio_tokens
will_bio_word
