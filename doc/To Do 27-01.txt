--- Initial
1. Study PII Pipeline
2. Study NER
3. Study DeBERTa and prereq
4. Fully understand the metrics (F-score / F-beta-score) 5x for recall
5. Write EDA tool(s)
6. Fully understand baseline implementation

---  Parts:



Detection and Recognition
 - (NER)
 - Regex

Decider  -   Chance / Context analyzer
   - POS
   - Custom labels
   - Other AI Models
   - 

Scorer
 - Recall(5) vs Precision
 - 

Score optimizer
   - Supervised? 


--- Concepts:



--- Questions:
Best PII pipeline curently
F-score, F-beta score
 - What is considered good
 - How good is current best score
Convert JSON labels to dataframe

--- Prompts:

In a PII Identification task, what is considered a good f-beta score


Can you give me a roadmap and maybe a timeline estimate for understanding and implementing my own PII identification architecture

How about this use-case: 

I have a dataset in JSON format containing 3 sections per document:

1. full-text: The full string of the document
2. tokens: The tokenized version of the full-text
3. labels: The label of the token in BIO B- (beginning), I- (inside), or O (outside) format

I want to quickly navigate snippets of the document containing the labels B- or I-. Can you suggest a sample code, a pipeline or a Python library for this use-case?
